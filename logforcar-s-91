this way with 17 slots it would be very difficult to find good cases so we increase the slots to train


this is with 20 slots

Shift = 20	Min clashes = 6930	at step 1

but after training the network, and after updating the neurons it gave the same results:( it is probably because the neurons are -1 most of the time and in unitupdate it always return -1.
Shift = 17	Min clashes = 1482	at step 4334
Shift = 19	Min clashes = 1632	at step 813
Shift = 20	Min clashes = 6930	at step 1
...



so after I implemented the updatecourses function in COurseArray it started to work.

after the same training with 20 slots, here are the results

Shift = 15	Min clashes = 2464	at step 657 (with 1000 iterations)
Shift = 15	Min clashes = 3468	at step 170 (with 1000 iterations)
